\section{Data Mining}
\label{sec:data_mining}

This section describes the experiments that were performed on the datasets to obtain a better understanding of what makes a good recipe.
First, the itemsets of ingredients are mined for general patterns using association rule mining.
After that, the dataset is divided into two clusters, a positive and negative dataset, using the rating dataset.
A decision tree model is then used to learn a decision boundary between these two clusters, which is then analyzed in detail.

\subsection{Association Rule Mining}
\label{subsec:association_rule_mining}

This section covers the analysis of the ingredient dataset using association rule mining.
Using the apriori algorithm, we mine the dataset for association rules with a confidence of $0.5$ and a coverage of $0.02$, resulting in a set of $1003$ association rules.
\cref{tab:rules_top10} shows the association rules that have the highest lift.
They describe patterns commonly found in sweet, oven-baked dishes, such as cookies and pies.
Nutmeg and cinnamon are often used in combination with clover in cookie mixes (e.g. in `speculaas'), so it is not strange to find the pattern \{nutmeg\} $\rightarrow$ \{cinnamon\}.
The list is however dominated by vanilla as the antecedent and very similar rules.
This could be caused by a strong bias towards these type of dishes in the dataset, because this would result in a high coverage, which is one of the interestingness measures the rules are pruned on.
Looking more closely at the recipes, this does not seem the case, however, as depicted before in \cref{fig:ingredient_frequencies}.
Many recipes include ingredients such as pepper, onions and cheese, which are normally not used in deserts.
This result shows that the ingredients used in these meals are more predictable, in that they are often used in a similar way.

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}
\label{subsec:collaborative_filtering}

In this section we look at how the user rating data can be used to build a recommender system that is able to suggest new recipes to users.
As described in \cref{subsubsec:user_ratings}, the dataset derived from Allrecipes consists of over $3$ million user ratings from $1$ to $5$ stars.
The rating matrix is very sparse, but we might be able to complete the matrix using well-known collaborative filtering techniques.
