  abstract  = {In Europe{\textquoteright}s culinary scene, a new Food Pairing Theory is all the rage among top chefs, particularly those with an experimental inclination. The main hypothesis of this theory is quite straightforward: the more characteristic aroma compounds that two foods have in common, the better they taste together. The hypothesis is based on the fact that 80 percent of food{\textquoteright}s flavor is determined by how our nose picks up volatile aromatic compounds. Although the elegance and simplicity of Food Pairing Theory makes it convincing, in this article it is shown that it is as scientifically unsound as it is popular with the practitioners of European haute cuisine. Moreover, it is argued that because of the impracticality of the Food Pairing Theory and the availability of easier food pairing alternatives, it is likely that this theory will not stand the test of time to become a part of cooks{\textquoteright} repertoires. It is a food fad that will likely disappear and soon make place for a new one.},
